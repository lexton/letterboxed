# Wordlists

This is an interesting flavor for how you can solve the letterbox

Letting you pick which wordlist is allowed.

## Specifics

### Google-10k

* Sourced from: https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english
* Caveats: proper nouns not removed - will not generate always valid results, names are present

### Unix
* Sourced from `/usr/share/dict/words`
* Proper nouns are capitalized at least, so are automatically removed since we work entirely in lower case

## Wordle
* Sources

## Test
* Sourced from: my brain
* Used for test cases, not an actually useful wordlist
